# Ethics manifesto 

## My Ethical Principles

A good rule of thumb is for me to put myself in the position of the people whose data I have. If someone had access to _my_ similar data, what would I not want them to do with it? How would I want them to keep my data safe? Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Ask myself why I'm using this data. Do I need to use private data to accomplish this, or could I use public data to finish this task? Is there a good reason for me to use this, or is it __only__ to further mine or someone elses' self interests? 

Once I get in the data science field, I'll probably make some mistakes and learn more about my personal ethics along the way. I'll then have a responsibilty to help and show those around me the dangers that I've seen and worked through.

## Reading Discussion

"if we can show the danger instead of telling about it, we can avoid or mitigate the danger without having to tell at all. Not only are ethical codes insufficient to improve ethical practice — they aren’t necessary either."[^1] Being told about a danger doesn't hold the same weight in someone's mind as being shown the danger. Seeing it with their own eyes makes it a lot more likely that they'll want to avoid that danger in the first place. Like the example with the pit (in the second comic in the article) once you show the person the pit, they aren't as likely to fall in, or go anywhere near the edge. They get to the point of being able to fall into the pit when they don't understand or see the full danger yet. <br>

"The Hippocratic Oath is an effective ethical code exactly because it’s not a statement of right and wrong. It’s a roster of costly signals. Costly signaling is the practice of deliberately putting yourself at a disadvantage in order to show you can afford the sacrifice ... If someone engages in costly signaling, it means they actually have an abundance of something — skills, knowledge, resources, strength, intelligence, commitment — that allows them to shoulder that cost. Those are the people you want to hire. Those are the people who have shown that they have enough competency that they are willing to take a hit in other areas."[^2]

"People in a business, on average over the course of their interactions with a data scientist, should increase the percentage of time and resources devoted to decisions that only humans can make."[^2] I need to remember my purpose as a data scientist. Am I trying to help others succeed, or am I just caring about myself and making money? Am I being successful in my job, do I feel good about what I do for work every day?

"Data scientists don’t need a list of ways to be virtuous. They need a list of ways to prove they aren’t charlatans. That will do more to ensure the health and trustworthiness of the profession than anything else."[^2] I can show myself and others where I stand ethically by my actions. That doesn't mean I have to follow some play book, but I need to make choices that I'll be proud of and that will show people what kind of person I am.
